# py-schwab-wrapper

`py-schwab-wrapper` is a Python wrapper for Schwab's API, designed to handle authentication, token management, and data retrieval from Schwab's market data services. The initial version provides functionality to get price history for a symbol, with OAuth2-based authentication flow.

## Features

Be sure to check out our CHANGELOG for full details on functionality

- OAuth2 authentication and token refresh.
- Fetch historical price data for a symbol.
- Get account information
- Get orders for a specific account
- Place orders with user friendly abstractions.

## Installation

You can install the `py-schwab-wrapper` package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install py-schwab-wrapper
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Obtain OAuth Credentials**: You need to get your `client_id` and `client_secret` from Schwab's developer portal.
2. **Set Environment Variables**: You can store these credentials in a `.env` file in your project root.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
SCHWAB_CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>
SCHWAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>
```

3. **Authenticate and Generate `token.json`**:
   The first time you use the API, you need to authenticate using Schwabâ€™s OAuth2 flow to generate a `token.json` file. You can use the included `authenticate.py` to handle this process.


## OAuth2 Authentication Flow

Before making API requests, you need to authenticate via Schwab's OAuth2 flow and store the access/refresh tokens in a `token.json` file. Here's how you can do it using the included `authenticate.py` script:

1. Run `authenticate.py` to start the OAuth2 flow:
    ```bash
    python authenticate.py
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the browser to authorize the application and obtain the tokens.

### A note on authentication
Be mindful if you configure your application's callback URL to be secure `https://127.0.0.1:5000/callback`, you'll need to set up HTTPS for your local Flask server. Here's how you can achieve this:
```
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```
Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information. This will create key.pem (private key) and cert.pem (certificate) files. And be sure to include them in your .gitignore file!

#### Additional .gitignore recommendations
```
# ...your boilerplate .gitignore file for python...

# Ignore .pem files
cert.pem
key.pem
.pem

# Ignore token.json file if you decide to do local storage of the token
token.json
```

## Example API Usage

Once authenticated, you can use the wrapper to get historical market data, get account information, or place an order. Be sure to check out our examples/ folder.

```python
from py_schwab_wrapper.schwab_api import SchwabAPI
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize the API wrapper with your credentials
schwab_api = SchwabAPI(client_id="<your_client_id>", client_secret="<your_client_secret>")

# Define the time range
now = datetime.now()
start_of_day = now.replace(hour=9, minute=30, second=0, microsecond=0)
end_of_day = now.replace(hour=16, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
start_date = int(start_of_day.timestamp() * 1000)
end_date = int(end_of_day.timestamp() * 1000)

# Fetch price history
price_history = schwab_api.get_price_history(
    symbol='QQQ', 
    period_type='day', 
    period=1, 
    frequency_type='minute', 
    frequency=5, 
    need_extended_hours_data=False, 
    need_previous_close=True, 
    start_date=start_date, 
    end_date=end_date
)

print(price_history)
```
