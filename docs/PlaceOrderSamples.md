# Sell Trailing Stop: Stock
Sell 10 shares of XYZ with a Trailing Stop where the trail is a -$10 offset from the time the order is submitted. As the stock price goes up, the -$10 trailing offset will follow. If stock XYZ goes from $110 to $130, your trail will automatically be adjusted to $120. If XYZ falls to $120 or below, a Market order is submitted. This order is good for the Day.
